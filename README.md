# Background
There are plenty of different roles in today's data job market. However, it is not entirely clear how the roles of üë®‚Äçüíº Business Analysts, üßë‚Äçüíª Data Analysts, and üßë‚Äçüî¨ Data Scientists differ.

### This project aims to answer the following questions:

1. How does the average salary compare between Business Analysts, Data Analysts, and Data Scientists?
2. How do the required skills differ between Business Analysts, Data Analysts, and Data Scientists?
3. Which are the top-paying skills for Business Analysts, Data Analysts, and Data Scientists?
4. Which are the optimal skills to learn for Business Analysts, Data Analysts, and Data Scientists?

# Tools I Use
To dive into the data and derive insights, I harness the power of several key tools.

- **SQL**: The basis for my analysis. It allows me to access and query the data set on data job postings provided by the Youtuber and Data Analyst [Luke Barousse](https://www.lukebarousse.com/).
- **Python**: Used to futher clean and visualize the data set to obtain answers for the questions posed.
- **PostgreSQL**: The data base management system chosen for this project.
- **Visual Studio Code**: My favorite code editor for analyzing data.
- **Git & GitHub**: Crucial for version control and sharing scripts and analyses, ensuring collaboration and project tackling.

# Analysis
Each SQL-query for this project tackled one of the questions I have about the data job market.
Here's how I approached each question:

### 1. Average Salary
To obtain the average salaries for Business Analysts, Data Analysts, and Data Scientists, I filtered the data to only include Business Analysts, Data Analysts, and Data Scientists. Moreover, I excluded remote jobs and focused on full-time jobs.

```sql
-- Let's have a look at the different job titles in the data set.
SELECT
    DISTINCT(job_title_short)
FROM
    job_postings_fact

-- Compute average salary grouped by job title.
SELECT
    job_title_short AS role,
    ROUND(AVG(salary_year_avg), 0) AS avg_yearly_salary
FROM
    job_postings_fact
WHERE
    job_title_short IN ('Business Analyst', 'Data Analyst', 'Data Scientist') AND
    NOT job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
    job_schedule_type = 'Full-time' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY
    role
```

Based on this query, I visualize the average salaries in a bar chart using Python.

```py
# Import packages
import numpy as np, pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Adjust default matplotlib settings
plt.style.use('tableau-colorblind10')
plt.rcParams['font.size'] = 12
plt.rcParams['lines.linewidth'] = 2
plt.rcParams['axes.titlepad'] = 10
plt.rcParams['axes.labelpad'] = 10
plt.rcParams['font.family'] = 'sans-serif'

# Read csv
df_avg_salaries = pd.read_csv('./data/1_avg_salary.csv')

# Create new column to display salary in 1000s
df_avg_salaries['avg_yearly_salary_1000'] = df_avg_salaries['avg_yearly_salary'] / 1000

# Plot
df_avg_salaries.plot(x='role', y='avg_yearly_salary_1000', kind='barh',
                     xlabel='Salary (in 1000 USD)', ylabel='', legend='',
                     title='Average Salary per Job Role');
```

**Insights**: 
- The average salary is highest for Data Scientists and lowest for Business Analysts.
- The difference in average salary between Data Scientists and Business Analysts (or Data Analysts) is much larger than the difference in average salary between Business Analysts and Data Analysts.
- All roles are well paid with an average salary of over 80'000 USD per year.

### 2. Top Skills per Role
To reveal the top required skills for Business Analysts, Data Analysts, and Data Scientists, I again filter for these roles and focus on onsite, full-time jobs using a CTE. As the skills required for a specific job are contained in two other tables, I join them with the CTE.

```sql
-- CTE to filter the jobs, i.e., only looking at onsite and full-time jobs for BA, DA and DSc
WITH filtered_jobs AS (
    SELECT *
    FROM 
        job_postings_fact
    WHERE
        job_title_short IN ('Business Analyst', 'Data Analyst', 'Data Scientist') AND
        NOT job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
        job_schedule_type = 'Full-time' AND
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
)

-- Join with skills tables and count number of job posts for a specific skill
SELECT
    job_title_short AS role,
    skills,
    COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) AS demand_count
FROM
    filtered_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON filtered_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
GROUP BY
    role, skills
```

Based on this query, I use Python to extract and visualize the top 5 required skills by role.

```py
# Read data
df_skills = pd.read_csv('./data/2_skills.csv')

# Group df by role and find 5 most common skills
df_skills_grouped = df_skills.groupby('role') \
    .apply(lambda x: x.nlargest(5, 'demand_count'), include_groups=False) \
    .reset_index(drop=False) \
    .drop('level_1', axis=1)

# Write helper function for plot
def plot_by_role(df_skills_grouped, role, ax, x_axis, x_label):
    temp = df_skills_grouped[df_skills_grouped['role'] == role].sort_values(by=x_axis, ascending=True)
    ax.barh(temp['skills'], temp[x_axis])
    ax.set_title(role)
    ax.set_xlabel(x_label)

# Plot
_, axes = plt.subplots(3, 1)

for i, role in enumerate(df_skills_grouped['role'].unique()):
    plot_by_role(df_skills_grouped, role, axes[i], 'demand_count', '# Job Posts')

plt.tight_layout(rect=[-1, -1, 1, 1])
plt.savefig('plots/skills.png', dpi=300, bbox_inches='tight')
```

<img src='plots/skills.png' alt='Top skills'>

**Insights**: 
- The top five skills for Business Analysts and Data Analysts are very similar. For both roles, SQL and Excel lead the list and also include Tableau, Power BI and Python.
- In contrast, the top five skills for Data Scientists are slightly different. The list additionally includes R and SAS but does not include Excel.

### 3. Top-paying Skills per Role
Filtering the job posts as previously, I compute the average salary per skill and role.

```sql
-- CTE to filter jobs
WITH filtered_jobs AS (
    SELECT *
    FROM 
        job_postings_fact
    WHERE
        job_title_short IN ('Business Analyst', 'Data Analyst', 'Data Scientist') AND
        NOT job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
        job_schedule_type = 'Full-time' AND
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
)

-- Compute average salary per skill and role
SELECT
    job_title_short AS role,
    skills,
    ROUND(AVG(salary_year_avg), 0) AS avg_yearly_salary
FROM
    filtered_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON filtered_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
GROUP BY
    skills, role
```

Similarly to question 2, I display the top-paying skills per role in bar chart created with Python.

```py
# Read data
df_pay_skills = pd.read_csv('./data/3_top_paid_skills.csv')

# Group df by role and find 5 highest-paying skills
df_pay_skills_grouped = df_pay_skills.groupby('role') \
    .apply(lambda x: x.nlargest(5, 'avg_yearly_salary'), include_groups=False) \
    .reset_index(drop=False) \
    .drop('level_1', axis=1)

# Plot
_, axes = plt.subplots(3, 1)

for i, role in enumerate(df_pay_skills_grouped['role'].unique()):
    plot_by_role(df_pay_skills_grouped, role, axes[i], 'avg_yearly_salary', 'Average Annual Salary (in USD)')

plt.tight_layout(rect=[-1, -1, 1, 1])
plt.savefig('plots/top_paid_skills.png', dpi=300, bbox_inches='tight')
```
